# AoC 2021 - Shane Adam
Advent of Code 2021 done in Perl 5.

I chose Perl because it was the language I used in my first 'professional' setting at a co-op placement. I wanted to take another look at it and see if it is as much fun as I remember it being.

## Executing
`perl -I . Day[x].pl`

`-I .` parameter adds current directory to list of dirs where Perl will look for Modules
